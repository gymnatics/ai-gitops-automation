# Sync Wave Fixes Applied

## Summary of Changes

I've fixed the sync wave ordering issues that were causing OpenShift AI deployment failures. The main problem was that the DataScienceCluster and DSCInitialization were trying to deploy before the OpenShift AI operator was ready.

## Changes Made

### 1. **OpenShift AI Instance Components**

| Component | Old Wave | New Wave | Reason |
|-----------|----------|----------|---------|
| redhat-ods-applications namespace | -1 | 10 | Must be created after operator (wave 5) |
| DSCInitialization | -1 | 11 | Must be created after operator and namespace |
| DataScienceCluster | 0 | 12 | Must be created after DSCInitialization |
| Wait for operators job | 12-13 | 8 | Must check operators before creating resources |
| Wait for CRDs job | 15-16 | 9 | Must check CRDs before creating resources |
| Wait for ServiceMesh job | 18-19 | 7 | Must verify ServiceMesh before operator checks |

### 2. **Correct Deployment Order**

```
Wave -10: Service Mesh Operator
Wave  -9: Elasticsearch Operator  
Wave  -8: Serverless Operator
Wave  -5: Service Mesh Control Plane
Wave   3: OpenShift AI operator namespace
Wave   4: OpenShift AI operator group
Wave   5: OpenShift AI operator subscription
Wave   7: Wait for Service Mesh
Wave   8: Wait for all operators to be ready
Wave   9: Wait for CRDs to be available
Wave  10: redhat-ods-applications namespace
Wave  11: DSCInitialization
Wave  12: DataScienceCluster
Wave  30+: Additional configurations
```

## Why This Fixes the Issues

1. **Proper Dependencies**: Resources now wait for their dependencies to be ready
2. **Operator Readiness**: The DataScienceCluster waits for the operator to be fully deployed
3. **CRD Availability**: We verify CRDs exist before trying to create custom resources
4. **Service Mesh**: We ensure Service Mesh is ready before deploying OpenShift AI

## Verification Steps

After applying these changes:

1. **Watch the sync progress**:
   ```bash
   oc get applications -n openshift-gitops -w
   ```

2. **Check operator readiness**:
   ```bash
   oc get csv -n redhat-ods-operator
   ```

3. **Verify the deployment order**:
   ```bash
   # Check jobs complete in order
   oc get jobs -A | grep wait-for
   
   # Then check resources are created
   oc get dscinitialization -A
   oc get datasciencecluster -A
   ```

## Remaining Considerations

1. **GPU Configurations**: Wave 35 items (GPU settings, notebook sizes) deploy after everything else
2. **Console Plugins**: Wave 10 for various operator console plugins is fine
3. **Tenant Applications**: Waves 0-3 for demo applications should be adjusted if they depend on AI
