# Red Hat AI Infrastructure GitOps

Welcome to the Red Hat AI Infrastructure GitOps project\! This project is a fork of the upstream [AI Accelerator project](https://github.com/redhat-ai-services/ai-accelerator) and is designed to deploy all of the required cluster components for AI Workloads to an OpenShift cluster.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Openshift 4.16+ cluster

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> There is a known issue with using Kubernetes version 4.17 in relation to the Node Feature Discovery Operator, which causes issues allocating nodes that use GPUs. It is recommended to avoid this version for now.

### Quick Start

Installation can be done using `./bootstrap.sh` script.

> [!TIP]  
> First time installs it is recommended to allow the script to walk through options, but future runs can be automated using cli flags, run `./bootstrap --help` for more information.
